ATS Resume Analyzer


The ATS Resume Analyzer evaluates the compatibility of a resume with a job description. It uses a generative AI model to calculate a match percentage, identify missing keywords, and generate a profile summary to help optimize resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

How It Works:
Upload Resume: Users upload a PDF of their resume.
Enter Job Description: Paste the job description for the position you're interested in.
Receive Results:
JD Match: A percentage that shows how closely your resume matches the job description.
Missing Keywords: A list of important keywords that are missing in your resume, which could improve its ATS compatibility.
Profile Summary: Suggestions on how to improve the resume to increase chances of getting noticed by ATS.
